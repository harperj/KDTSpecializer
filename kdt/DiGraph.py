		create a DiGraph Instance with edges with source represented by

		When the surfer is visiting a vertex that is a sink
		(i.e., has no outward edges), she hops to any vertex
		in the graph with probability one.

		Optional argument epsilon controls the stopping
		condition. Iteration stops when the 1-norm of the

		hopping to a random vertex in the graph).
