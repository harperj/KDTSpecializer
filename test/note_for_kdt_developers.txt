Place tests in this directory. Note that tests must currently be run inside
this directory by doing 'python TestKDT.py'.

Tests for packages may also be run separately (e.g., 'python TestDiGraph.py').

Note that kdt must be in your Python search path.
If you're doing active development and don't want to continually install new
kdt builds then point the PYTHONPATH environment variable at the svn trunk:
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/kdt/svn/trunk
(that's ../ from where this file is)
